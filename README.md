# DRF Add Ons

**A collection package for Django REST Framework**<br>

`DRF Add Ons` is a collection package collected over a period of one year from various sources.<br>
In each function/class I've specified its source in `docstrings` inside `Source` / `Sources`.<br> 
Wherever there isn't any source, the module has been created by me for my personal use.<br>
This may come in handy to all those who are going to use `Django REST Framework` for creating `API`.<br>

I'll like to mention following names for certain contributions:
- **[Civil Machines Technologies Private Limited](https://github.com/civilmahines)**: For providing me platform and funds
for research work. This project is hosted currently with `CMT` only. 
- [Mahen Gandhi](https://github.com/imlegend19): For making this repository into a library. At the time of this commit,
he is an intern with `CMT` and is assigned with the task of making this as a `Python Package` hosted on 
[PyPi](https://pypi.org/).
- [Aditya Gupta](https://github.com/ag93999): For updating this repository and projects using this repository as per
the latest standards. He is also an intern with `CMT` and is assigned with same task as `Mahen`. He updated various
projects using this library to use `GenericAPIView`, such as `CreateAPIView`, `ListAPIView` rather than 
`ValidateAndPerformView View`
